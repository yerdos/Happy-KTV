# Happy-KTV

> The project for Shanghai college students' innovative projects

## Background

> Nowadays, people like to go Karaoke with their friends in their spare time, which is very enjoyable for most people. However, there exists some problmes when we are having fun with our friends in KTV.
>

1. There are at most 3 microphones which means that no more than 3 people can sing at the same time
2. The microphone is very easy to break down
3. People like to use their phones to do anything

## Innovations

> To solve the problems, we want to develop an app to control the KTV system by the following ways:

1. Get song list from the KTV client
2. Add or delete some songs from the KTV list
3. Play or stop the song on KTV client
4. **Sing through the phone's microphone**

## Achieved

> We have finished almost all of the projects, including

1. Two threads to receive different socket streams, one of which is used to get the sound data, which on the other hand, used to transport orders and other data.
2. A KTV client to handle with the request
3. Android side finished
